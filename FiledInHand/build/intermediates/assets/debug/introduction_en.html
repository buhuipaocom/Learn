<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Field In Hand is an Android application for geologists in field work. It gathers functions like strike-dip measurement, taking photo with location, making notes, data management and exporting files. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With GPS turned on, it doesn’t only fulfill the need of locating and taking photo, but also provide the information about the direction of device, magnetic declination, CSV format file and KML exporting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The photos and data files will be put into the SD/FieldInHand dictionary. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Its simple design makes it easy to handle. The design of a compass with a gradienter gives users the experience of real compass use as well as direct observation of measurement result. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bubble in the gradienter appears in blue when the device is horizontal, in red when the device is measuring one direction and in gray when the device is not stable and not suitable for measurement. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Touching the gradienter can start or freeze the application that is convenient for situations when you need to measure the data in one place and read it in another place better for observation or share the result and discuss it with others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two methods available for measurement. The first one is that you can touch the center circle of the gradienter when the values are stable. When the application is frozen, press the “data” button will record the information. The second is that after the values are stable, press the data button multiple times without freezing the application to get different measuring results. Data can be handled statistically. </span></p>
